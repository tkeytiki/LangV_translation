At the start of each stage, there will be a story introduction. After that, you will be taken to the (F4FF)battle preparation menu(F3FF).(FDFF)In the battle preparation menu, you can hire mercerenaries, buy, sell, and equip items, and position units.(FCFF)When you have placed all commanders on the map, select (F4FF)attack(F3FF) to begin the battle.(FDFF)However, for the first battle there are no mercenaries for hire and no shop, so you can only check the battlefield.(FCFF)Also, the unit positions are predetermined.(FDFF)You can view the explanation of a command by pressing the (F4FF)<TRIANGLE> button(F3FF) while it is highlighted.(FEFF)
You can have the subject experience a (F4FF)virtual battle(F3FF) first-hand.(FCFF)Through this battle you can learn combat in practice.(FDFF)Proceed?(FEFF)
First off, let's outline the basics of the (F4FF)action system(F3FF).(FDFF)The method for determining turn order is a system similar to real-time.(FCFF)Hence, the turn count is just a metric used for scenarios with a time limit.(FDFF)When a unit commander's (F4FF)action meter(F3FF) fills to max, you can give them orders.(FCFF)The meter fills up with the passage of turns.(FDFF)The action meter is displayed in the information panel at the bottom of the screen. Its (F4FF)size(F3FF) is indicative of the quantity of action points.(FDFF)When a unit carries out your command, the cost of the expended action is deducted from the action meter.(FDFF)That is to say, there is no concept of taking one action per turn, and you can give commands whenever the action meter is full.(FDFF)With that, let's launch the virtual battle program.(FEFF)
Lastly, there are two important inputs you can give.(FCFF)If we do not do the virtual battle, I think we should at least make sure the subject understands this part.(FDFF)(F4FF)Action system basics(F3FF)(FCFF)Confirm?(FEFF)
