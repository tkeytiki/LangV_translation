Magical Research Lab - Education Wing(FFFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç§Lord Rainforce, is this it? I believe this(FCFF)is part of Marshal Gizarof's research(FCFF)lab...(F5FF)(F8FF)(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç•Correct. The results of his research lie(FCFF)here. The (F4FF)vessel(F3FF) we seek is within.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç¶Vessel(F5FF)(F8FF)...?(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)ÇßThrough his research, Gizarof used genetic(FCFF)engineering to create a race of(FCFF)superhumans called "vessels."(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç®The intruders are already here.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç©Then we have no choice. We must fight.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç™Even if you say that(F5FF)(F8FF)...(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç´If we don't wish to fight, we must run.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç¨Fight, or flee...(F5FF)(F8FF)?(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç≠Too late. They're here.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç¡Two vessels? But which one's our target?(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç÷Sorry to keep you waiting.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)ÇŸYou made it.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)ÇœI made it, but(F5FF)(F8FF)...(FEFF)
<BULLET>Show concern.(FEFF)
<BULLET>Rush her.(FEFF)
<BULLET>Inquire.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç–Lambda! Lambda?(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç—I'm fine. Don't worry.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç“Lambda, hurry!(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç”Why don't you go ahead without me?(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç‘Is that guy okay?(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç’We should worry about ourselves right now.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç“Lambda, hurry!(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç◊Move quickly. You're falling behind.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)ÇÿI know.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç◊Move quickly. You're falling behind.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç∫Looks like our opponent is quite(FCFF)formidable.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)ÇªYou can tell?(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)ÇºWell...their advance is efficient.(FDFF)(00FB)ÇΩWhat do you think? Do we engage?(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)ÇæWe've only just awoken, so we can't access(FCFF)our full power. I suggest retreating.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)ÇøThen let's head towards (F4FF)the exit(F3FF). It's(FCFF)unguarded.(FEFF)
Escape Point(FFFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç¿Understood.(FEFF)

(FCFF)(F8FF)...(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç´Ugh, that hurts...(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç∂You are vital to my plans.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç∑Come quietly and we won't harm you.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç∏Let's behave, shall we?(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)ÇπWhoa!(FEFF)
(FCFF)What?(FEFF)
(FCFF)Lord Rainforce?!(FEFF)
(FCFF)Don't worry. It's just a minor scratch.(FEFF)
(FCFF)But, if something were to happen to you...(FCFF)Just don't push yourself too hard.(FEFF)
(FCFF)Aizel, I'm sorry.(FEFF)
(FCFF)I can't fathom you defeating Aizel and(FCFF)myself. But I can't die here.(FEFF)
(FCFF)No way...I let my guard down...(FEFF)
(FCFF)Step back, Aizel. I can't let you die now.(FEFF)
(FCFF)Lord Rainforce, I'm sorry.(FEFF)
(FCFF)Here, of all places...(FEFF)
(FCFF)Damn it!(FEFF)
(FCFF)Alright. It seems the enemy can't move.(FEFF)

(FCFF)(00FB)Ç¬They seem capable enough. As expected of(FCFF)Gizarof's work.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç√If we had more soldiers, surely we'd have(FCFF)captured them with ease.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)ÇƒWe had to do it this way to avoid(FCFF)detection.(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç≈Shouldn't we have enlisted "them"?(FEFF)
(FCFF)(00FB)Ç∆Not for this kind of job.(FEFF)
